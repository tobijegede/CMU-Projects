# CMU-Projects in Python
I have worked on the following projects at Heinz College using Python:

1. Consolidated Course Selection Tool:
 This project was the final project for the course 90-819 "Intermediate Programming with Python". The files associated with this project are: "Abstract.pdf", "Course_Evaluation_results.csv", "Documentation.pdf", "User Instructions.pdf", and "goldengirls_finalproject_vfinal.py". The abstract file provides a high-level overview of the purpose of this project, along with a list of the Python libraries used to complete this project.
   
   
2. Project for Data for Black Lives Pittsburgh Hub (PghD4BL):
I used pandas to find counties with similar populations and racial demographics to Allegheny County, PA, based on information from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The file associated with this project is: "National_County_Jail_Estimates_final.py". The output of this code is two .csv files, one that contains the names of the counties with similar populations and racial demographics to Allegheny County, PA and the second that contains the names of the county jails and their jail populations for the counties with similar populations to Allegheny County, PA.
