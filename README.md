# CMU-Projects
This repository contains the files for the projects that I've worked on during my time at Carnegie Mellon University as a graduate student in the Public Policy &amp; Data Analytics program at Heinz College. The projects that I've worked on are broken down into separate branches that correspond with the programming/statistical language that I used for the project.
